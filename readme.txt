Wumbo's Tagger for Flashpoint (WTF)

Rapidly update Flashpoint entries using the legacy Genre format to the more specific Tag format.

Before running the program:

- WTF.exe and all its dependencies (including tags.json) must be located in a folder directly under the root Flashpoint folder (any name works but "WTF" is recommended)
- CLIFp.exe must be located in a folder titled "CLIFp" under the root Flashpoint folder

Controls:

- When prompted to choose an option:
  - Up arrow to move cursor up
  - Down arrow to move cursor down
  - Enter to choose the highlighted option

- When prompted to select multiple items from a list:
  - Up arrow to move cursor up
  - Down arrow to move cursor down
  - Space to select/deselect the highlighted item (selection is indicated by an X)
  - Enter to move onto the next step (on the tag screen, you can use this to skip a genre)

Please note:

- Resizing the console window screws up the text
- The console will probably render most non-English titles with a lot of ?'s
- The genre/tag lists can scroll even though there's no indicator (so don't assume that what you see is what you get)
- The exported meta edit does not look very pretty but it should import fine
